# puppagram

Puppagram is a simplified instagram clone implementing DOM manipulation behaviors in response to API calls. Users can fetch a new dog image with 
the 'more puppies' button, like/unlike images (which will reflect in the number of likes), and post/like/delete comments. Users can also add 
selected emojis to their comments.
